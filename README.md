# Social Analytics Pipeline

Data engineering pipeline for collecting, storing, normalizing, validating and orchestrating social media metrics.

The repository is the source of truth. Work is split into small, reviewable tasks so the project can continue without relying on long chat history.

## Current Status

- Phase: Phase 2 - Orchestration and history
- Current task: TASK-031 - Condense documentation in English
- Last completed delivery: TASK-030 - Real YouTube Airflow DAG

## Workflow

Before coding a task:

1. Review `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TASKS.md` and `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
2. Tell the user the proposed changes, scope, exclusions and validation plan.
3. Implement only after the user confirms or asks to continue.
4. Update documentation and progress.
5. Run local validation.
6. Open a PR so GitHub Actions and CodeRabbit can review it.
